2. delete,replace mentioned word from a file 
3. number of lines, words, characters
4. convert .txt file in .json
5.l=[1,2,3] just make it a string.
6.l=[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7,[8,9,10]] for single dimentional list

Assignment 7: 
find the start position of the largest block of repeated characters in a given string
Ans:
import re
s=raw_input("Enter String: ")
max_word=max([max(re.findall(c+'+',s),key=len) for c in set(s)],key=len)
print "max_word: ",max_word, "length: ",len(max_word),"index: ",s.find(max_word)

Assignment 8:
get union and intersection of lists:
l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
l1=[1,7,2,8,9]
print set(l) & set(l1)
print set(l) | set(l1)

Assignment 9:
input: fun(5)
output: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]
def fun(v):
    l=range(v)
    l1=range(v)
    l1.reverse()
    return l+l1[1:]

Assignment 10:
 Make two dimentional list to one dimentional:
l2=[]
l=[1,2,3,[1,2,3],4,[5,7]]
for i in l:
	if isinstance(i,list):
		l2.extend(i)
	else:
		l2.append(i)
print l2

Assignment 11:
input fun('abc')
output: [[],][a],[b],[c],[a,b],[b,c],[c,a],[a,b,c]]
def fy(s):
    result=[]
    result.append([])
    for i in range(len(s)+1): 
        for j in range(i):
            result.append(list(s[j:i]))
    result.append([s[-1],s[0]])
    print result
fy('abc')

Assignment 12:
Remove duplicates from the list:
a=[1,2,3,2,3,4,1,,3,4]
s=set(a)
s1=s.copy()
a=[s.pop() for i in s1][::1]

Assignment 13:
scores =  {"classScore":[("mohan", 80), ("satish", 90), ("purnesh", 40), ("venkat", 30)]} sort the list in assignding order of marks..
import operator
scores =  {"classScore":[("mohan", 80), ("satish", 90), ("purnesh", 40), ("venkat", 30)]}
scores1=    {"classScore": sorted(scores['classScore'],key=operator.itemgetter(1))}
print  scores1

Asignment 14:
Write the difference between sort and sorted method in python
	alist = [1, 3, 2]
	alist.sort()
	alist
	output:
	[1, 2, 3]
		alist.sorted()
			Traceback (most recent call last):
			  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
			AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'sorted'
		 alist = [1, 3, 2]
		sorted(alist)
			output:
			[1, 2, 3]

	sort() is a method of list.  As explained, it sorts the list in place
	and it does not return the list as a reminder of that fact.

	sorted() is a builtin function, not a method on list, because it's
	more general taking any iterator as its first argument (for example an
	open file), not just a list.  It of course does return a list.

Assignment 15:
Can we use a list for a key in dictionary ?
Ans: No, because list is mutable object. Dictionary accpet only immutable object as a key.

Assignment 16:

           1) My name is, Nagesh
           2) I am from , Hyderabad
           3) I studied MCA in, CBIT
read the lines in text file and write data to a csv file with question in one column and responses in other column.

Ans:
try:
    f1=open("text1.txt")
    f2=open("text2.csv",'w')
    f2.write("question,answer\n")
    for i in f1.readlines():
        f2.write(i)
except Exception as err:
    print err
finally:
    f1.close()
    f2.close()


Assignment 17:
l=['1','2','3'] get the sum of the list
sum(map(int,l))

Assignment 18:
l1=[1,2,3,4] l2=[5,6,7,8] sum of two lists
[i+j for (i,j) in zip(l2,l1)]

Assignment:19
Make two dimentional list to one dimentional:
input: fun(5)
output: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]

Assignment:20
input fun('abc')
output: [[],][a],[b],[c],[a,b],[b,c],[c,a],[a,b,c]]

Assignment: 21
Find out the 3rd max value without sorting a list?
Ans:
l=[2,3,4,1,-10,-20]
for i in range(2):
    m=max(l)
    l.remove(m)
print max(l)

Assignment: 22
Convert list of tuples to tuple of list
Ans:
l=[(1,2),(2,3),(4,5)]
l1=[]
for i in l:
    l1.append(list(i))
print tuple(l1)
